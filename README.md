## Usage
You can drag and drop image files onto the fields or double click to open a file dialog.

ImageDiff has two optional command line arguments that allow you to load one or both images on startup.

Example: 

`./ImageDiff.exe orig.png modified.png`

On Windows you can also drag and drop one or two image files onto the executable.
